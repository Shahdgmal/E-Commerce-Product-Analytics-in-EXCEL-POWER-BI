# E-Commerce Product Analysis Project

## Overview
###This project involved analyzing raw retail data containing invoices, product details, customer IDs, transaction dates, quantities, prices, and country information.
The process included:

- Running descriptive statistics to identify data distribution patterns and detect outliers.

- Performing data cleaning to handle missing values, remove duplicates, fix errors, and standardize fields.

- Creating new calculated fields and DAX measures for tracking KPIs such as number of customers, purchase frequency, returns, and total revenue.

- Preparing the dataset for segmented analysis of sales vs. returns, retail vs. bulk orders, and customer purchasing behavior.

- The result is a clean, structured, and analysis-ready dataset that supports reliable decision-making and visualization in Power BI.
